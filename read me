Welcome to my version of Wordle!!!

How this works is that you will guess which county is selected and input your guess

If you guess it right, then you will be alerted that you are correct

If you guess it wrong, then it will prompt you to guess again

If it gets too hard and you want to give up, then you can type "I give up" and it will end the game

Make sure to type "County" at the end of the county name (for example, Ramsey County and not Ramsey)

Have fun and thank you for trying my game!!




counties = ["Hennepin County", "Ramsey County", "Dakota County", "Anoka County", "Washington County", "St. Louis "
                                                                                                          "County",
                "Olmsted County", "Stearns County", "Scott County", "Wright County"]
